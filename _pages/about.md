## ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Jijee Bhattarai

I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at **Binghamton University**, working under the supervision of Dr. Ajinkya Keskar. My research focuses on **gender and health**, particularly in the context of **developing economies**. I am especially interested in how **intra-household inequalities** affect policy outcomes and family-level decision-making.
